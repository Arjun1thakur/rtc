# ðŸ§ª Testing the Bug Fixes

## Issues Fixed:

### âœ… 1. Leave Call Issue

**Fix**: 
- Improved cleanup of peer connections
- Better WebSocket connection handling  
- Proper stream track stopping
- Reset all UI states when leaving

### âœ… 2. Chat Messages Issue  
**Problem**: Users could only see other people's messages, not their own
